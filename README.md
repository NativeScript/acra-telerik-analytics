# ACRA Telerik Analytics
Contains the source code of the `org.nativescript.ata` library used by the [nativescript-marketplace-demo](https://github.com/NativeScript/nativescript-marketplace-demo) app for Android.

## How to Build
```
cd "ACRA Telerik Analytics"
../gradlew packFramework
```

This generates widgets-debug.aar and widgets-release.aar files located in the widgets/build/outputs/aar folder.
And generates tgz files in dist folder.
